# NLP-project
NLP project on movie review. Made with logistic regression for prediction. Data set from kaggle.

📌 Project Overview  
This project performs Sentiment Analysis on IMDB movie reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques.  
The model classifies reviews as Positive or Negative based on their textual content.  

🎯 Objectives  
Preprocess raw text data  
Convert text into numerical features using TF-IDF  
Train a Logistic Regression classifier  
Evaluate model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix     
Visualize insights from the dataset   

🛠️ Tech Stack   
Python   
Pandas   
NLTK   
Scikit-learn   
Matplotlib
